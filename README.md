# PaperPlanes-twitterbot
Paper planes is a Twitter bot that tells the story of paper planes migrating to the moon. The bot generates an image of randomly placed paper planes flying east. These images have a narrative attached to them as these planes fly out. The narratives are witty and short, like: “Flying looks good today”, or “We’re going to the moon. OkBye.”. The bot then posts these to Twitter after regular intervals of time. I used Node.js to implement this bot. I learnt making this bot from Daniel Shiffman’s wonderful video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman, and the Twit-js library by Ttezel: https://github.com/ttezel/twit.
